# Feistel Cipher in C

This repository contains the implementation of a Feistel cipher in the C programming language, which was developed as part of the Computational Cryptography Introduction course. The Feistel cipher is a symmetric encryption technique that operates by dividing input data into blocks and performing multiple rounds of transformations on the data blocks to produce the encrypted output.

## Features

- Complete implementation of the Feistel cipher in C.
- Support for encryption and decryption of messages.
- Customization of the number of rounds and block size.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! If you wish to improve this project, feel free to send pull requests or open issues to discuss new features, bug fixes, or documentation improvements.
